# JumperGame
This game is a simple but alternate version of hangman. A word is selected from a list, and hidden from the player. The player's job is to guess which
word has been chosen, through the process of trial and error. The player can only guess the wrong letter in the word four times before they lose the game
and must restart with a new word.
